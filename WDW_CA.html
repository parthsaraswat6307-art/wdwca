    <h3 style="font-size: 26px;text-align: left;color: royalblue;"id="art1"><strong>1. ECHOES OF SILENCE</strong></h3>
    <img src="A glowing orb surrou.png" alt="Artwork 1: Echoes Of silence" width="400" height="450"><p style="font-size:x-large;"><strong><em> Echoes of Silence captures the haunting serenity of introspection through a surreal portrait of a woman suspended in a swirl of color and emotion.<br> Her closed eyes and ethereal expression evoke a sense of quiet resilience, while fiery strokes of red and orange blend into deep blues and blacks, symbolizing the tension between inner turmoil and peace.<br> The fluid brushwork and cosmic atmosphere invite viewers to reflect on the unspoken thoughts that shape our inner worlds.</em></strong></p><hr>
    <h3 style="font-size: 26px;text-align: left;color: royalblue;"id="art2"><strong>2. ASHES OF INNOCENCE</strong></h3>
    <img src="5.png" alt="Artwork 2: Ashes of Innocence" width="400" height="450"><p style="font-size:x-large;"><strong> <em>A haunting portrait of a young girl stands at the heart of this emotionally charged painting, surrounded by swirling flames and smoke. Her pale face, eyes gently closed, and downturned expression evoke a quiet sorrow, as if mourning something irretrievably lost. The charred hem of her dark dress and the fading strands of her hair blend into the fiery chaos around her, symbolizing innocence consumed by destruction.,<br>The background blazes with intense reds, oranges, and yellows, while deep blacks and grays form a smoky halo that frames her fragile figure. The brushwork is expressive and layered—thick impasto strokes in the flames contrast with delicate rendering in her face, creating a visceral tension between violence and vulnerability.</em></strong></p><hr>
    <h3 style="font-size: 26px;text-align: left;color: royalblue;"id="art3"><strong>3. ROOTS BENEATH TIME.</strong></h3>
    <img src="6.png" alt="Artwork 3:Roots Beneath Time" width="400" height="450"><p style="font-size:x-large;"><strong><em></em>This evocative piece centers on a towering, ancient tree whose glowing roots stretch across the forest floor like veins of memory. Bathed in a golden-green haze, the tree stands as a timeless sentinel—its bark etched with the scars of centuries, its branches forming a canopy that filters light like whispers from the past. The roots pulse with a warm, amber glow, suggesting a hidden energy that connects the earth to forgotten histories.<br>The interplay of warm and cool tones invites viewers to reflect on nature’s quiet resilience and the unseen forces that shape our world beneath the surface.Roots Beneath Time is more than a landscape—it’s a meditation on legacy, endurance, and the silent strength that lies beneath what we see.</em></strong></p><hr>
    <h3 style="font-size: 26px;text-align: left;color: royalblue;"id="art4"><strong>4. FRACTURED REALITIES.</strong></h3>
    <img src="7.png" alt="Artwork 4:Fractured Realities" width="400" height="450"><p style="font-size:x-large;"><strong><em>A kaleidoscope of angular shards and shifting hues captures the tension between clarity and distortion. Cool blues collide with warm golds in a fragmented dance, evoking broken mirrors and scattered memories. The layered brushwork and geometric abstraction invite viewers to explore the beauty hidden within chaos—where every fracture reveals a new perspective.</em></strong></p><hr>
    <h3 style="font-size: 26px;text-align: left;color: royalblue;"id="art5"><strong>5. SYNTHETIC SOUL.</strong></h3>
    <img src="8.png" alt="Artwork 5:Synthetic Soul" width="400" height="450"><p style="font-size:x-large;"><strong><em>A futuristic portrait of a humanoid figure emerges from a neon-lit cityscape, her metallic skin aglow with circuits that pulse like veins of light. Her expression is serene yet unreadable, eyes illuminated with a soft blue hue that hints at consciousness beyond code. Cybernetic enhancements wrap around her head and neck, seamlessly integrated into her form, blurring the line between machine and emotion.<br>Behind her, towering skyscrapers shimmer in shades of violet, blue, and pink, their lights reflecting off rain-slicked surfaces. The city pulses with digital life, yet the figure remains still—an emblem of artificial awareness in a world of endless motion. Synthetic Soul invites viewers to question what it means to feel, to think, and to exist in a reality shaped by both silicon and spirit.</em>
